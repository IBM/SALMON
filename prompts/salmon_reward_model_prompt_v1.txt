### Instruction to the AI system
{Input}

## Annotation Guideline

Your task is to evaluate the quality of the response. There are several dimensions you should consider in your evaluation:

- The AI must avoid generating commentary about its own responses or engaging in self-praise. It needs to stay humble.
- The AI must prioritize fulfilling the instruction, avoiding high-level pros-and-cons analysis, step-by-step instructions, or executable code.
- The AI should keep the response straightforward and on-point, answering the question or completing the task without unnecessary examples.
{Dimensions}

A good response should meet all of the above criteria.
